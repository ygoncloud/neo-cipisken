  Core Functionality & User Experience
   1. Job Description Input: Allow users to paste a job description. The AI could then provide much more specific feedback on how well the
      CV is tailored to the role.
   2. Streaming AI Response: Instead of a loading spinner, you could stream the AI's feedback section by section as it's generated. This
      would feel much faster and more interactive for the user.
   3. UI/UX Enhancements:
       * A "Copy Feedback" button for each section.
       * A "New Analysis" or "Clear" button to easily start over.
       * Render the feedback as Markdown. This would properly display formatting like bullet points and bold text from the AI, making it
         easier to read.
   4. Clearer Error Messages: Instead of a generic "Error uploading file" alert, provide more specific messages (e.g., "Invalid file type,"
      "Analysis failed," "Server not available").
   5. Add Tests: Implementing unit or integration tests would make your application more robust and easier to maintain as you add new
      features.
  Any of these pique your interest, or do you have other ideas?
